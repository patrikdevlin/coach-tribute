							<h2>Lilly</h2>
							<p>"Just put it under John” is coach’s favorite catchphrase when he takes his grandkids out to Jamie Hollanders for breakfast. Well maybe second favorite catchphrase behind “special squeeze”, “golden handshake” and “ I can’t wait until you go to Lafayette”. Coach loves Lafayette and pours tons of effort into his annual pig roast and religiously follows all their sports. He follows not only the Lafayette Leopards but also the New Hope-Solebury lions. While playing in my field hockey and lacrosse games I can hear Coach’s legendary throat clear from any point on the field. I’m never surprised when I walk off the pitch and see Coach in a soup-stained sweater or the vest cousin John bought him for Christmas. Speaking of Christmas, Coach is the oyster stew master. His secret in the recipe is using a homemade shoe horn that I made him as a stirrer. It may not be sanitary but it sure enhances the flavor. Coach not only gives great food to people; he also brings great food to dogs. Whenever he comes over, he usually brings a pig heart, pig ears, pig liver, or pizza slices for Chance the dog. When he doesn’t bring food, he still finds snacks in our cabinet to feed Chance even though I beg him not to. The best part about Coach is that he is the only good opponent in gin. We love that game and have played it together ever since he finished teaching me how to swim. All in all, Coach is the best grandfather anyone could ask for and we all love him dearly. HAPPY BIRTHDAY COACH!! I hope your birthday is as great as some real authentic maple syrup.<br><br>
							Love, <br><br>
							Your Favorite Grandkid (Lilly)</p>

							<h2>Riley</h2>
							<p>Wiener wiener. What is that game? I’ve had some late nights pondering the specifics. I’m still not sure why he mentioned it that one Thanksgiving dinner. Did Donald and Marty play? Was Coach the best? The 50s must’ve been a crazy time. Mysteries like this further cement Coach’s legacy as a funny, light-hearted grandfather who I constantly look up to. I’ve had a lot of great times with you, but our time shad fishing is a memory I cherish and will never forget. I had no idea what I was doing, but somehow, with your guidance, I still reeled that sucker in. Most fishermen enjoy fishing alone, but for some reason you wanted to bring along your youngest grandson and I’m glad we spent those moments together. Happy birthday Coach!<br><br>
							Love,<br><br>
							Riley</p>

							<h2>Patrik</h2>
							<p>I could head back home to Washington Crossing any time during the day and there would be a 75% chance I run into Coach at Colonial Farms. I'd walk in and Coach would say "Patrik! What's new? Whatever you like, it's on me." Everyone knows this type of authentic kindness that I'm speaking of. There's something very special about how Coach cares for others and the mistake would be to assume this leads to a softness in character. But it is quite the opposite. Coach has imparted on me what it means to be strong, tenancious, and hard-working but at the same time loving, lighthearted and warm. The beautiful thing is that you can see these qualities in all of his children and grandchildren because of how close he has kept all of us. Each lesson learned prograting through the family, and while I may have learned something from Megan, she may have picked it up from Aunt Leigh, all leading back to the source... Grandy and Coach. Much love and Happy Birthday!</p>

							<h2>Graham</h2>
							<p>I've played sports my whole life, and I knew I could always look over to the sidelines and see Coach.  He wasn't holding a clip board like the name would suggest, but a supportive smile as I pursued my dreams.  Coach never taught me the X's and O's of soccer, he had more important knowledge to pass on, he taught me the X's and O's of life.  Whether it be how to play gin, the importance of an "ice" cold drink, or how to be comfortable with nudity; Coach's wisdom will always be with me. I could not have asked for a better patriarch to grow up under. Cheers to 85!</p>

							<h2>Collin</h2>
							<p>When my friends find out that I call my grandfather “Coach,” it usually requires a bit of explanation. It’s not a common thing to call a grandparent, but to me it’s always felt completely appropriate. Throughout my life, Coach has fulfilled the spirit of his moniker in a very real way, whether it was showing me how to fish on the shores of the Outer Banks, taking me to eat the best peperoni in the world at Conte’s Pizza, or teaching me important life lessons like, “Restaurants won’t always have real maple syrup, so don’t be afraid to bring your own.” When he eventually became my actual “coach” by taking over the as the lawyer advisor for my Mock Trial team in high school, it was a natural role for him to assume. And I know I’m not an exception. Coach has been a constant presence in the lives of all of my siblings and cousins, guiding us figuratively and, quite often, literally – like how he would guide us to the Duck Deli each year as though we were actually a flock of ducklings following single-file behind our parent. I’m sure Coach shared plenty of words of wisdom on those trips to Conte’s or the Duck Deli, but it’s the trips themselves that I remember most because they became important traditions for the family, the memories of which are as valuable and long-lasting as the lessons Coach imparted along the way.</p>

							<h2>John</h2>
							<p>How to Hock Loogies:<br><br>

							AgghhhuhuhHUHhuh. Take that big ole’ snot oyster and tuck it into your right cheek pocket. Think about giving it a name. Lenny…. Lou… too on the nose. Larry? Larry. Point to the center console and use that stiff jawed talk-out-of-the-side-of-your-mouth voice to tell whichever grandkid is unfortunate enough to be in the front seat to “reach in the there and grab a napkin” (Or paper towel. Tissues long since abandoned for durability and square footage concerns). Smile to yourself as they sift through the graveyard of discolored, crusty remains. Though don’t actually smile because Larry is approaching like critical dam-breaking mass and any expression other than a pair of tight puckered lips may result in catastrophic clothes-soiling failure. You’ve likely put your shirt through enough today. Wave off whatever sepia stained wood pulp product your copilot finally worked up the courage to actually physically hold and offer you. There’s a stop sign coming up and Larry's an outdoor dog.<br><br>


							Car at rest, crack the door just enough to put both sides of the gap in a kind of splash zone type danger. Lean low, aim, and blow hard. Door shut and belt buckled accelerate slowly through the intersection, eyes fixed on the awestruck gape-mouthed faces in the rearview.<br><br>


							In all seriousness Coach is the architect of all the childhood memories I hold most dear and, more often now, the inspiration that informs my tough decisions. He is my friend (sometimes) and the man that brings so many of my favorite people together so often. I feel honored to share a name with him and send my love and admiration to accompany the passing of another year as a great man and a better grandfather.</p>

							<h2>Peter</h2>
							<p>Coach means exactly that to us. Our coach. He's started a dynasty of lawyers, sous chefs, and Peak members. He's taught us to tread water, to shuck oysters, to play tennis, to troll for cobia, to cook stew, to cherish a "special squeeze," and to cheer for basketball. We've learned from him how to laugh at life, to love this family, to take pride in our history and accomplishments, to be irreverent, to bring people together, to be unflappable and good spirited in the face of hardships, and to be curious and engaged with the world. He's the best kind of coach we could have and the only kind that truly matters. And for that, we love our Coach and are so grateful for him.</p>

							<h2>Megan</h2>
							<p>When I think about Coach, I think about food (and <strong>not</strong> because of his belly!!) I think about oyster stew, Thanksgiving turkey (with oyster stuffing), pizza at Conte's followed by ice cream at Thomas Sweet, stacks of pancakes at Duck Deli with real maple syrup, The Lafayette Pig Roast. Some of these foods I think about fondly. They make my mouth water. Others make me gag. But the memories of sharing these foods with our wonderful, quirky family make me feel so full. Not Thanksgiving full, but full of love. Like my heart might explode with love. These foods remind me of Coach, and Coach reminds of the wonderful family that he and Grandy created that I'm so lucky to be a part of. <br><br>

							Happy 85th birthday, Coach! Thanks for bringing our family so many wonderful and wacky traditions. They've given me some of my most cherished memories. I love you <3</p>

							<h2>Claire</h2>
							<p>I can’t say enough about what an amazing grandfather Coach is or his incredible influence on my life. When considering his influence, the thing that stands out is his desire to share his interests with his grandchildren. Be it sailing on the catamaran, shad fishing or the Lafayette Pig Roast, he’s given us all a glimpse of how to live a life full of passion.<br><br>

							However, the thing about coach that has had the greatest impact on me is actually something that he lacks: a filter. He’s passed this down to my father and with their collective running commentary, I’ve developed a thick skin, which has served me well throughout my life. The examples are countless, but I’ll share one that has etched a place in my memory... Being the extremely present grandparents that they are, Coach and Grandy always attended pre-dance photo shoots throughout middle school and high school. On the eve of my eighth grade dance, they were at our house along with several of my friends as we got ready for our last dance of middle school. It should come as no surprise that at that point in my life I had only spoken with the opposite sex when required by teachers and wouldn’t have known what to do if one had approached me to dance. I spent hours searching for the right dress and finally found the perfect one. It was beautiful, classy and clearly sent the message: back off. After an hour or so of hair, makeup and gossip it was time for the dress unveiling. As I walked onto the back deck, Coach was of course the first to comment: “Oh my God... she’s got breasts!” You can imagine how this may have impacted a normal pre-pubescent, self-conscious girl. Not me. I paused for a moment, looked down and replied proudly “Sure do!” (For those who are confused, I was wearing a push-up bra and they stopped growing shortly thereafter. No one has ever uttered those words to me since.)<br><br>

							Coach made me value honesty and directness in communication, which has helped me immensely in navigating social and work situations.  I’m less sensitive, I try not to read into things, and instead look for the positive spin. It saves lots of unnecessary worry about what someone actually meant. Coach helps us all live in a world where people say what they mean and mean what they say. <br><br>

							As I left for the dance that evening, I had a renewed confidence knowing that if any male approached, I could knock him out with my gigantic breasts. </p>

							<h2>Coach's Thanks</h2>
							<p>Thank you all so much for the warm and humorous 85th birthday wishes. They were all right to the point. Can you believe they even brought tears to my eyes. <br><br>

							Am I not the luckiest coach in the world to have nine such thoughtful caring grandkids?? You can’t imagine all the joy and fun each one of you, in your own way, have brought to my life. <br><br>

							I hope you will always look back on our times together with happy loving thoughts, and remember some of the lessons of life I’ve tried to impart, such as kindness, patience, humor, humility and honesty. Remember to work hard, to use only real maple syrup, and above all remember to always share the GOLDEN HANDSHAKE! <br><br>

							With Love, <br>
							Coach</p>
